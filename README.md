My [Patreon sponsors](https://patreon.com/egoist) can suggest and vote for their favorite project ideas to help prioritize them.

## Suggestions

These can be anything, a package that you need for work, a desktop or web application you'd love to have, a framework that would help make something easier for your team, a blog article to learn more about a subject I'm familiar with, just let me know by [creating an issue](https://github.com/egoist/sponsors/issues/new)! The more sponsors I have, the more time I can dedicate to these projects.

## Voting

[Leave a :thumbsup: to vote](https://github.com/egoist/sponsors/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc). Resulting priorities will be filtered by sponsors, if you'd like to see work done on any of these projects, or my existing software, consider [supporting](https://patreon.com/egoist) me.
